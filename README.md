Conky-Paired

Intended to be a small desktop application that lets users choose between background/conky script pairs. 
Conky scripts are to be configured to be somewhat integrated with the background image.

Currently, I manually tweak conky scripts to display data nicely and would like an easy way to store good configurations and to easily switch between them.
