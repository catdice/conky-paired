Conky-Paired

A small desktop application that lets users choose between desktop wallpaper andconky script pairs. 

Conky scripts are to be configured to be somewhat integrated with the background
 image.

Previously, I manually tweaked conky scripts to display data nicely and wanted an easy way to store good configurations and to easily switch between them.
